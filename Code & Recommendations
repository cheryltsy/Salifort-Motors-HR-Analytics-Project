# Business Scenario and Problem

As an HR Analytics consultant, you've been tasked with addressing the critical issue of employee attrition at Salifort Motors, a fictional company. Your mission is to identify the key factors driving employee turnover and to develop predictive models that can forecast which employees are most likely to leave the company.

To achieve this, you will analyze a comprehensive HR dataset provided by the company, utilizing Python and advanced Machine Learning techniques. This project aims to not only predict employee attrition but also to offer actionable insights that can help Salifort Motors enhance their employee retention strategies.

# HR Dataset

The dataset contains 14,999 rows and 10 columns. These are the data in the columns:
1. satisfaction_level: Employee reported job satsifaction level from 0 to 1
2. last_evaluation: Score of employee's last performance review from 0 to 1
3. number_project: Number of projects employee contributes to
4. average_monthly_hours: Average number of hours employee worked per month
5. time_spend_company: Years the employee has been in the company
6. Work_accident: Whether the employee has been in a work-related accident
7. left: Whether or not the employee has left the company (1=resigned, 0=current employee)
8. promotion_last_5years: Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years
9. Department: The employee's department 
10. salary: The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)

Step 1: Importing packages into Jupyter Notebook and loading dataset
