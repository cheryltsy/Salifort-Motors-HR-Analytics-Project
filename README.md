# Salifort-Motors-HR-Analytics-Project
In this project, we will be analysing HR data from a fictional company, Salifort Motors to help them understand what factors impact employee turnover. We will be using Machine Learning to predict which employees are likely to leave. Thereafter, we will put forward recommendations to help enhance employee retention.
